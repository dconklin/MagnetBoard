# MagnetBoard

This is a project which queries the Twitter REST API for tweets matching a Word, Hashtag or Handle posted from a specific location. The project then displays the tweets relative to how far they were made from the location. Tweets are displayed in a 'Fridge Magnet' style, which allows the end-user to drag and move them around to form their own sentences, phrases, poems, etc.

To view this project, download or clone the repo and then run `node server.js` (assuming you have node.js installed on your computer. Then, navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice.
